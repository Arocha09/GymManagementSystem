Our project aims to develop a UVA Rec Gym Membership & Class Scheduling System that enables users to manage their gym memberships, book fitness classes, and track attendance. The system will serve both gym members and gym administrators, providing an easy-to-use interface for managing memberships, class bookings, and attendance records. We aim to enhance gym operations at UVA Rec and ensure that all members (and students) have a seamless and wonderful experience as they engage in fitness activities.

SET UP --- Download repository.
Use pip install -r requirements.txt to download the dependencies, specifically the psycopg2-binary for db communication and flask to work our app routes for frontend.
Once completed, navigate to the repository in terminal. Once in the folder, you can use python3 app.py to start the application, and click the link it provides to see our webpage.

We have several trial usernames and passwords. For admin we used admin_user and adminpassword. For instructor we used instructor_test and instructor_password and for member we used john_doe and password123.
