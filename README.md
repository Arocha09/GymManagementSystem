Our project aims to develop a UVA Rec Gym Membership & Class Scheduling System that enables users to manage their gym memberships, book fitness classes, and track attendance. The system will serve both gym members and gym administrators, providing an easy-to-use interface for managing memberships, class bookings, and attendance records. We aim to enhance gym operations at UVA Rec and ensure that all members (and students) have a seamless and wonderful experience as they engage in fitness activities.

SET UP --- Download repository. Once downloaded, navigate to the repository in terminal. Once in the folder, you can use python3 app.py to start the application, and click the link it provides to see our webpage.

When testing the webpage, we used username john_doe and password password123 as a successful login. Once logged in, you can see profile and enrolled classes for the user. To enroll in a class, navigate to the classes link and click enroll for the class you want. The read feature is the profile and classes of the user, and the write feature is the enrolling in classes. We have more features to implement.
