Our project aims to develop a UVA Rec Gym Membership & Class Scheduling System that enables users to manage their gym memberships, book fitness classes, and track attendance. The system will serve both gym members and gym administrators, providing an easy-to-use interface for managing memberships, class bookings, and attendance records. We aim to enhance gym operations at UVA Rec and ensure that all members (and students) have a seamless and wonderful experience as they engage in fitness activities.
